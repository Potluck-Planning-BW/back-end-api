# back-end-api

## Endpoints

POST /api/auth/register --> registers a new user. 
   - Register requires a first_name, last_name, email, username, and password

POST /api/auth/login ---> login and receive token to access rest of API
   - Login requires a username and password

ALL endpoints below this line require being logged in with a token stored to access - if this is annoying for development purposes I can turn it off
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   - Requires event_name and event_date, has optional properties of event_description, event_address, event_time

DELETE /api/users/:id --> Deletes user with the specified ID, not sure why you would really need this, but good to have

PUT /api/users/:id --> Can update the user information that you passed in on register, just pass in whatever changes you want with the property names matching the ones from register

TO BE ADDED TODAY:

- need a way to invite/ uninvite a user to potluck
- need a way to add items and assign them to people
- need to add the get request for viewing a single potluck specific to user
- need a way for someone who's been invited to change their attendance status
